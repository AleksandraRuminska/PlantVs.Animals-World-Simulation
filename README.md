# Plant Vs. Animals World Simulation

Simulated world of different animals and plants that multiply and fight for survival. The world is presented as a 10x10 grid. 
There is a specified number of turns, during which animals move and plants grow automatically, randomly choosing one of the adjacent cells. The human (if it exists) is controlled by the arrow keys and can be given a special ability - "Antelope's speed (moves two fields instead of one)" if the number "2" is pressed. 

Along with the preexisting animals and plants, new ones can be created on the empty field by clicking on it and choosing the species. There is an exception when it comes to human players - there can be only one on the board.

The game was created for the classes at University. The code was written in Java with Swing.

All the icons used in the games were created by me.
